# Kaggle Competition: Digit Recognizer  

This repository contains my submission for the **Kaggle Digit Recognizer Competition**, which focuses on recognizing handwritten digits from images using machine learning techniques.  

The **goal** of the competition is to classify each image in the test dataset into the correct label (digit).

## Repository Structure  

This repository includes the following files:  

1. **`digit_recognizer_output.csv`**  
   - This file contains the predicted labels for the test dataset generated by the machine learning model.  
   - It is formatted as required for submission on Kaggle.  

2. **`digit_recognizer.py`**  
   - This Python script includes the machine learning pipeline for the competition.  
   - It processes the training data, trains the model, evaluates performance, and generates predictions for the test dataset.  
   - The code is designed to be efficient and follows best practices for data processing and model training.  

3. **`sample_submission.csv`**  
   - A sample submission file provided by Kaggle, used as a reference for formatting the predictions file.  
   - Includes columns `ImageId` and `Label` for test dataset predictions.

## Approach  

1. **Data Overview**  
   - **Training Data**: Contains labeled images of handwritten digits (0â€“9).  
   - **Test Data**: Contains unlabeled images where predictions are to be made.  

2. **Modeling**  
   - Used machine learning techniques to classify the handwritten digits.  
   - The script preprocesses the data, trains a model on the training set, and predicts labels for the test set.  

3. **Evaluation**  
   - The model is evaluated on accuracy and performance using the training dataset before generating predictions for the test dataset.  

4. **Submission**  
   - The output file (`digit_recognizer_output.csv`) adheres to Kaggle's required submission format:  
     - Column 1: `ImageId`  
     - Column 2: `Label` (predicted digit).

## How to Use  

1. **Clone this Repository**  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git  
   ```  

2. **Run the Script**  
   - Make sure to have the training (`train.csv`) and test (`test.csv`) files in the same directory as the script.  
   - Execute the Python file to generate predictions:  
     ```bash  
     python digit_recognizer.py  
     ```  

3. **Submit Predictions**  
   - Use the generated `digit_recognizer_output.csv` file for submission to Kaggle.
